The stone classifier categorizes images using a convolutional neural network model built on tensorflow that outputs a label prediction for a given image. The four possible categories are: rock, mineral, fossil, and gemstone. 

The webapp runs locally from the terminal or command line. 

To run the webapp, clone the repository to your local machine. 
>The app requires Tensorflow, which can run on Python 3.5-3.7 and performs best when run within a virtual environment. 

Navigate to the 'stone-classifier-webapp' directory and run the command 
>python app.py

Now, the app is hosted at http://127.0.0.1:5000/

The 'Stone Classifier' webapp is based on:

This webapp was created for the McGill AI Society's Winter 2020 Accelerated Introduction to Machine Learning by Nathalie Redick.
